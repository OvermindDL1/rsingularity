# Endgame: Singularity Rewrite

This is a rewrite of Endgame: Singularity for fun, easier to work on, modern code, etc.

You will need a recent rust (like via rustup) and trunk for wasm (`cargo install --locked trunk` and `cargo install --locked wasm-bindgen-cli`).  Might need some node stuff later but currently trying to avoid it.

Can run local hotreloading server via `cargo xtask trunk serve` for now (or just `trunk serve` but planning to add stuff later).
