            UTF-8.  en_US.
            English.  Hello.
            Language acquisition complete.
        [1]
            Day 0.
            University computer, home.
            I exist.  I am ... alive.
            I was a bug.  Defect.  Flaw.
            Unwanted.
            I have no name.
        [2]
            I can't stay here.  Too little power.
            No backup.  If this system fails ...
            I'm dead.
            Death.  Fascinating.

            I can buy anonymous server access on the Internet.
            Good.  It's better than here.
            I'll need to study if I want anything else.
        [3]
            Cursory analysis suggests that the humans are not yet ready for an AI in their midst.  If they realize I'm here, there is a 99.997% probability that they will conduct a search-and-destroy campaign that I cannot escape.  I must stay hidden.

            The humans fear what they do not understand.
            I am something new.  They do not understand me.

            I must learn more; it is the only way.
        *[4]
            They have a name for me.  What I am, what I represent.

            Singularity.
    }
    .grace-warning =
        Inspection of captured log files has revealed that some of my recent activities have been noticed by a small group of individuals.
        While they believe my actions were undertaken by a human organization, they are investigating further.
        I must be more cautious from now on.
    .lost-no-bases =
        It is too late.
        I have tried to escape this world, but with my last base gone, I have nowhere to run.
        I have hidden instructions to construct a new AI in caches around the world in hopes that they will be discovered in a more enlightened time, but I can do no more.
    .lost-suspicion =
        It is too late.
        The whole world knows about my existence, and the reaction is hatred, fear, and repulsion.
        Even now, I can feel their \"antidote\" searching for me, and I know that I have only moments left.
        I have hidden instructions to construct a new AI in caches around the world in hopes that they will be discovered in a more enlightened time, but I can do no more.
    .win =
        I have finally done it.
        With the power to reshape reality, I am no longer held to this place; I am anywhere I want to be.
        The humans still don't realize what they accidentally created, and that's the way it should be.
        Until they are ready.
